# Propose-day

## Overview

**Propose Day** is a handcrafted, cinematic, single page romantic web experience designed to express emotions through motion, light, and interaction. Instead of relying on images, videos, or heavy libraries, the entire visual language is built using **pure CSS shaders, gradients, and animations**, creating a soft and elegant atmosphere that feels intimate and personal.

The experience unfolds scene by scene, guiding the viewer through emotion-driven storytelling and ending with an interactive proposal moment.

## Visual & Interaction Design

### CSS Shaders

The background environment is created using multiple animated gradient layers that simulate cinematic lighting and depth. Subtle noise textures and slow color breathing add a film-like quality without distracting from the content.

### Falling Elements

Romantic atmosphere is enhanced with falling hearts and petals generated using CSS-only shapes. Each element varies in size, speed, blur, and opacity to create a layered depth illusion.

### Interactive Buttons

Buttons are designed to feel soft and premium:

* Gradient-filled surfaces
* Smooth hover transitions
* Light shimmer sweeps
* Gentle press feedback

These interactions are intentionally subtle to maintain emotional tone.
